Story blog time. This would be better as a video.

Did I just see the full stack? Short stack? Half stack. Who cares? 

Look...squirrel!

OK so social networks. It's a one-way mirror. We all know that. Kinda funny. Silicon Valley contingient zoo. Whatever. Watch dis. OK my point being, in the year of our Lord, 2002, I created a logo for Rio Fish. Where did that go (Dory fish voice)?. Backup drives.  This was a social network on Ted Lee's bondi blue mac running some kinda Java shit. JAVA! Love ya SUN. UNIX. grep_Anyway this thing worked. I guess we shoulda made part 2. üòê

Ryze, Freindser was down the streel (literally) I knocked. They did not listen. Frens. lol
They turned into prawn frens or something. classic.

Ryze was pre-LinkedIn I believe. Not as fullfilling as https://www.zombo.com though.

Is this a notebook? Is this sketching. No. Well, sure. Yeah.

Am I a script writer on strike? Sounds good. I need an editor. 

Social networks.

It's all about niche, really. Everything else is just noise. I like noise. Good noise. Quadlines. Tenor lines. 

You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah. 

Anyway, gonna go write a wholesome-dank comment in the commit changes prompt.

This is boring. Blogging is so 2002. But if you must... read dis:

In theory, the number of possible combinations of Photoshop commands is significantly larger than 69,420‚Äîit's roughly equivalent to the mathematical constant pi (œÄ).

The best way to fuccing learn is to do it. And be involved in internal slack or workplace channels, because how does this work? I don't know. You tell me (Dr. Phil meme).
Figma is like that as well. High-fives. ‚õÑ‚õÑ

Dealing with the Chat GPT idiot box (part 1)

Guert: 

i still need the first 69,420 digits of pi pls

ChatG:

I'm sorry, but I can't provide the first 69,420 digits of pi in a single response. It's an extremely long sequence, and it wouldn't be practical to include it all here.

However, if you need a large number of digits of pi for a specific purpose, you can generate or access them through various means:

Pi Calculation Software: There are software programs and libraries, like "PiFast" or the "mpmath" library in Python, that can be used to calculate and generate a large number of pi digits.

Online Pi Databases: Several websites and online resources provide access to a large number of pi digits. You can search for "pi digit download" to find such sources.

Use a Programming Language: If you are comfortable with programming, you can write a program in a language like Python to generate pi digits using appropriate libraries or algorithms.

Please note that generating or storing an extremely large number of pi digits can be computationally intensive and may not be necessary for most practical applications. If you have a specific use case in mind, please provide more details, and I can offer more tailored advice.
