The best way to fuccing learn is to do it. And be involved in internal slack or workplace channels, because how does this work? I don't know. You tell me (Dr. Phil meme).
Figma is like that as well. High-fives. ‚õÑ‚õÑ

Dealing with the Chat GPT idiot box (part 1)

Guert: 

i still need the first 69,420 digits of pi pls

ChatG:

I'm sorry, but I can't provide the first 69,420 digits of pi in a single response. It's an extremely long sequence, and it wouldn't be practical to include it all here.

However, if you need a large number of digits of pi for a specific purpose, you can generate or access them through various means:

Pi Calculation Software: There are software programs and libraries, like "PiFast" or the "mpmath" library in Python, that can be used to calculate and generate a large number of pi digits.

Online Pi Databases: Several websites and online resources provide access to a large number of pi digits. You can search for "pi digit download" to find such sources.

Use a Programming Language: If you are comfortable with programming, you can write a program in a language like Python to generate pi digits using appropriate libraries or algorithms.

Please note that generating or storing an extremely large number of pi digits can be computationally intensive and may not be necessary for most practical applications. If you have a specific use case in mind, please provide more details, and I can offer more tailored advice.
